                <p>Praised for her “bright resonance and immaculate technical management” (OperaWire), 
                    soprano <span class="highlight">VICTORIA ANTOINETTE DAVIS</span> is fast emerging as 
                    one of opera’s most compelling new voices—recognized for her powerful tone, 
                    nuanced musicianship, and commanding stage presence. Known for the emotional clarity 
                    and depth she brings to every role, Davis moves fluidly between classic and contemporary 
                    repertoire with natural authority.

                    <br> <br>

In the 2024–2025 season, Davis makes her role debut as Margru in Amistad (Anthony Davis)
 with Connecticut Lyric Opera, and returns to Verdi to cover Alice Ford in Falstaff with 
 Geneva Light Opera.

 <br> <br>

Her recent highlights include Highway 1, U.S.A. (Mary) with Little Opera Theatre of 
New York and Opera Ithaca, the title role in Suor Angelica with Opera Susquehanna, 
Awakenings (Lily) with Odyssey Opera—featured on the BMOP/sound recording—and Proving Up 
(Mrs. Zegner) with Opera Ithaca. She originated a role in Felix Jarrar’s Stardust with 
Helios Opera, written expressly for her voice, and appeared with Opera Baltimore and 
American Opera Projects in New York.

<br> <br>

In 2023, Davis covered Indra Thomas in La Vestale with Teatro Grattacielo, marking a key 
step in her exploration of early Romantic and Verdi repertoire.
Her performances have earned consistent critical acclaim: OperaWire lauded her “flawless” 
rendition of “Tu che invoco” as “the night’s highlight.” I Care If You Listen wrote that 
her “warm tone breathed life into the music,” while The Ithaca Times described her voice 
as “powerfully compelling.”

<br> <br>

Davis is also a District Winner in the Metropolitan Opera Laffont Competition, a 
Finalist in both the Jensen Foundation Vocal Competition and the James Toland Greenfield 
Awards, and a prize recipient from the Giulio Gari Foundation, Gerda Lissner Foundation, 
and Harlem Opera Competition, where she won First Place.

<br> <br>

A native of Washington, D.C., Davis holds degrees from Oberlin Conservatory (B.M.) 
and Mannes School of Music (M.M.).

<br> <br>

Beyond the stage, Davis was recently named one of 100 Changemakers featured in the 
Milkenn Museum’s “American Dream” Tapestry Exhibit—a Smithsonian Affiliate and permanent 
installation honoring leaders whose work bridges artistry, innovation, and community. Her 
inclusion celebrates her impact at the intersection of opera and STEAM, where she continues 
to redefine how classical music engages the modern world.

<br> <br>

With a growing portfolio of national appearances and a voice that embodies elegance, 
strength, and purpose, VICTORIA ANTOINETTE DAVIS stands as both an artist and architect of 
the future of opera.</p>
